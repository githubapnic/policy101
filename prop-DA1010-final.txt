prop-DA101v002: Improving WHOIS Contact Accuracy Through Annual Validation and Structured Remediation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposer:
Saima Nisar


1. Problem Statement
-------------------------
A significant proportion of APNIC WHOIS contact information — including admin-c, tech-c, and IRT emails — is outdated, unresponsive, or invalid.
This undermines:
    - Abuse management and incident response
    - Coordination between network operators
    - Obligations to respond to security incidents
    - The accuracy and utility of APNIC’s public registry
    - The ability of CERTs/CSIRTs and LEAs to reach responsible parties
APNIC’s current IRT validation mechanism provides partial coverage but is insufficient to ensure overall WHOIS contact quality.

2. Objective
-------------------------
To improve the accuracy, responsiveness, and reliability of WHOIS contact information in the APNIC region by introducing:
1.	Annual validation of admin-c, tech-c, and IRT email contacts
2.	A clear remediation process for invalid contacts
3.	Lightweight enforcement measures to encourage timely updates
4.	Transparency reporting at an aggregate (non identifying) level

3. Proposal
-------------------------

3.1 Annual Automated Validation
APNIC will annually send validation emails to:
    - admin-c
    - tech-c
    - IRT contacts
Contacts must click a unique validation link or update their details in MyAPNIC.

3.2 Remediation Window
If a contact fails validation:
    - A 90 day remediation period begins
    - Automated reminders sent at 30/60/90 days
    - Members update the contact or nominate a replacement

3.3 Enforcement Ladder
If validation still fails after 90 days:
1.	WHOIS object marked as “invalid”
2.	MyAPNIC capabilities restricted to contact related updates
3.	Resource transfer requests paused until validation is completed 
    - Does not affect routing or existing resource usage
3.4 Exemptions and Special Cases
    - NIRs may integrate the system into their internal processes
    - Small LIRs may request a one time 90 day extension
    - Critical infrastructure operators may request temporary deferral
3.5 Transparency
    - Only aggregated regional statistics published
    - No individual member details disclosed


4. Advantages
-------------------------
    - More effective abuse handling and security coordination
    - Reduced operational friction between networks
    - Increased trust in WHOIS data
    - Better alignment with global routability and accuracy expectations
    - Improved CERT and LEA outcomes


5. Disadvantages
-------------------------
None Identified

6. Impact on Members
-------------------------
Administrative:
    - Annual validation step requiring minimal action
    - Contact updates may require internal process changes
Operational:
    - Faster incident response
    - Reduced misdirected abuse reports
Financial:
    - No direct cost to members
    - APNIC bears engineering/operational cost
